# Fourier transforms to deconstruct 2D images
## Usage
Download the presentation.py and Fourieranim.py files. Note that I do not own all of this code, I have taken help from WiraDKP (github)

## Demonstration
Access the lespaul drawing with lespaul.html. Make sure to download the folder that has all the frames to be animated.
